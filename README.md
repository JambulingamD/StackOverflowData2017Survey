# CRISP-DM process for data analysis
CRISP-DM process is a standard methodology to analyse data.

## Objectives:
We all like to get paid more!!!
Based on my gut feeling the following are the factors to increase the pay:
1. Influence of education on salary
2. Relation between years of experience and salary
3. Effect of knowing more than one programming language
So, lets see if we can support them with data. 

## Dataset
I need data to validate my gut feeling. Investigating, I found out that Stack Overflow did a survey in 2017 on Salary. It is publicly available at "[Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)". This dataset got salary and other attributes of the software developers. I am going to use this to validate my gut feeling.

## Prepare data:
In this step, I will load the data into the Pandas DataFrame. Take a peek at the dataset to understand the data types.
Then, I will handle the missing data and outliers. So, that the dataset is ready for statistical analysis.

## Analyze:
I will use the Pandas methods to analyze to substantite my assumptions.

## Visualize:
I will use the plotting feature of DataFrame to visualize the findings. Picture worth a thousand words!!!

## Acknowledgmentsgments:
Thanks for the data provide by Stack Overflow at
[Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
