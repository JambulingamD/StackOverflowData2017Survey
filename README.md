# CRISP-DM process for data analysis

## Dataset
CRISP-DM process is a methodology to analyse data. For that, I need a dataset. So, I am going to pick the "[Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)".

## Objectives:
I am going to analyze the data to understand the following:
1. Influence of education on salary
2. Relation between years of experience and salary
3. Effect of knowing more than one programming language

## Prepare data:
In this step, I will load the data into the Pandas DataFrame. Take a peek at the dataset to understand the data types.
Then, I will handle the categorical and missing data.

## Analyze:
I will use the Pandas methods to analyze the data to answer the 3 questions.

## Visualize:
I will use the plotting feature of DataFrame to visualize the findings

## Acknowledgmentsgments:
Data source is from Stack Overflow.
